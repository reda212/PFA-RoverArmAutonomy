# PFA-RoverArmAutonomy
Autonomous rover with KUKA arm for object detection, navigation, and manipulation. Uses ML, 3D modeling, ROS, and Simulink for control.




## Description: 
This repository contains the code and resources for a rover equipped with a KUKA arm that is capable of autonomous navigation and object detection. The project utilizes machine learning techniques for object detection, 3D modeling for environment perception, ROS (Robot Operating System) for communication and control, and MATLAB Simulink for control theory. The rover is capable of autonomously navigating its environment, detecting two specified objects, and picking them up using the KUKA arm.
